    <h2>About This App</h2>
    <p>This personal to-do list app is built with Flask and Jinja2 templates.</p>
    <p>Tasks are stored in an in-memory Python list, so everything resets when the server restarts.</p>
    <p>Use it to practice routing, template inheritance, forms, and basic UI design.</p>
